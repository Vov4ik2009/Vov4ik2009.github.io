				<h1 align="center">Become a Photography & Conservation Volunteer in South Africa!</h1>
				
				<p>Have you always wanted to be a wildlife photographer? Here’s a chance to learn about wildlife photography, put your knew skills into practise during Big Five game drives, and contribute to wildlife and nature conservation at the same time. Set in South Africa’s famous Kruger National Park, this wildlife photography volunteer project offers a unique program in a stunning environment. During the 4-week project, you’ll hone your photography skills during an intense course taught by a professional wildlife photographer. You’ll spend the rest of your time photographing animals such as lions, leopards, elephants, and rhinos, and a selection of your images will be used for conservation education purposes. On top of this, you’ll have the opportunity to contribute to hands-on conservation efforts that help preserve this incredible environment.</p>

				<p>Your daily routine as a wildlife photography volunteer will be a safari dream. After learning all the ins and outs of wildlife photography (from an inspiring pro!), you’ll go out on game drives on most days, photographing the famous African Big Five, as well as many other incredible creatures that grace the African bush. And apart from photographing African wildlife, you can also focus on capturing the ever-changing and stunning landscapes the game reserves have to offer. A selection of your images will be added to a photographic database that offers free services to charities in the conservation field, who can use the images for awareness and fundraising efforts. In addition, some of your pictures will be used during conservation education programs in the surrounding communities.</p>

				<p>On top of the wildlife photography you’ll be doing, you’ll have a chance to get your hands dirty and participate in general conservation work in the Kruger area. You’ll be able to assist with hands-on field work, such as clearing alien invasive plants and removing snares, and with the collating of data and compiling of animal identy-kits that are part of larger conservation research. It’s a unique volunteer project that allows you to contribute to important conservation work, while becoming the best wildlife photographer you can be and building up an impressive portfolio of pictures! The project runs throughout the year, with monthly start dates, and photographers of any level can apply to join!</p>

				<h1 align="center">How to volunteer in Africa with animals</h1>
				
				<p>Marathon viewings of Meerkat Manor, the Wild Thornberries, and the Lion King have left you with the burning desire to dash off to Eastern Africa and spend your days surrounded by zebras, giraffes and those goofy birds that eat bugs off the backs of rhinos. And how could you not? One look at a baby cheetah and anyone with a heart would want to give up all their earthly possessions and devote their time to snuggling them and singing them lullabies.</p>

				<p>Even the question of the animal populations you’ll work with as a volunteer in Africa depends on location, program site and your qualifications -- remember, there’s far more to African wildlife than just lions! While there are loads of great volunteer programs that allow you to work with animals in Africa, there's also a lot to know before you book your ticket.</p>
